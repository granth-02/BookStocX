  <h2>What is BookStocX ?</h2>
  <p>Welcome fellow readers, BookStocX is an online platform where readers around the city can exchange books with each other. We provide an online platform where people can add books that they are done reading and are catching dust on your shelf. After they are done adding the books anyone interested in reading the book can contact the owner and offer them a book and complete the exchange. BookStocX also allows readers to donate their books, this is a non-profit website where everyone can share their love for reading and gaining knowledge!</p>
  <h2>Our Aim !</h2>
  <p>In the modern-day world all of us are connected over the internet(ironic huh?) but we have forgotten the power of a books. Books are magic few open up a portal to the world beyond our imaginations, some help us develop and make our selves better, some share anecdotes and life learnings, and all of the bestow knowledge upon the reader. We aim to connect people over their interest in books and spreading knowledge. So join us in making this world an interesting place!</p>
